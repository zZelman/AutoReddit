AutoReddit
==========
Development platform: Fedora 19

Target platform: cross platform

Libraries used: Jsoup -> http://jsoup.org/

Description: 

This is a minor bot intended to be run while the user is doing other things, such as at work, at class, or simply doing other things on the computer. It works by asking the user via command line arguments for things such as the Reddit page, how many searches, how often to do those searches, etc. It then sorts the downloaded links by their net upvotes, and displays them in decending order to the user.


TODO:

* Google Chrome support
* Varification that this is actually cross platform
* GUI for displaying the links -> IDEA: HTML generator
