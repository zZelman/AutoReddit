AutoReddit
==========
Development platform: Fedora 19

Target platform: cross platform

Libraries used: Jsoup -> http://jsoup.org/

Description: 

This is a minor bot intended to be run while the user is doing other things, such as at work, at class, or simply doing other things on the computer. It parses a config file "bot.config" which the user can edit, within reason (see config file). The HTML Generator section of the bot generates a minimalist html file, and presents it to the user.


TODO:

* Google Chrome support
* Verification that this is actually cross platform
* New module: music subreddit player
